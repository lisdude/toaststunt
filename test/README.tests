Tests are written in the Ruby programming language using the
Test::Unit framework. The Parslet library is used to parse responses
from the ToastStunt server under test.

To run the tests:

1) Ensure you have Ruby 1.9.3 or later installed.

2) Ensure you have Bundler installed.

3) Install dependencies.
    bundle install

4) Create the following symlinks in the executables/ directory:
    ln -s `which echo` echo
    ln -s `which sleep` sleep
    ln -s `which true` true

5) Build the server and copy the executable into the test directory.

6) Verify the settings in test.yml are accurate for your configuration.

7) In one console/terminal/window, run the ToastStunt server in the test directory:
    ./moo Test.db /dev/null 9898

8) In another console/terminal/window, run the tests:
    make

9) Clean up the moo executable and the files created in /tmp:
    make clean
