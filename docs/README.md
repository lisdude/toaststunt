## Features

- SQLite
- Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE)
- Simplex Noise
- [Argon2id Hashing](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2)
- 64-bit Integers (with the choice to fall back to 32-bit integers; $maxint and $minint set automatically)
- HAProxy Source IP Rewriting (see notes below if you need to disable this)
- User friendly traceback error messages

- Networking improvements:
    - IPv6 connection support
    - Threaded DNS lookups
    - Secure TLS connections in `listen()` and `open_network_connection()`

- Waifs:
    - Call :recycle on waifs when they're destroyed
    - A WAIF type (so typeof(some_waif) == WAIF)
    - Waif dict patch (so waif[x] and waif[x] = y will call the :_index and :_set_index verbs on the waif)
    - '-w' command line option to convert existing databases with a different waif type to the new waif type
    - `waif_stats()` (show how many instances of each class of waif exist, how many waifs are pending recycling, and how many waifs in total exist)
    - Parser recognition for waif properties (e.g. thing.:property)

- Basic threading support:
    - background.cc (a library, of sorts, to make it easier to thread builtins)
    - Threaded builtins: sqlite_query, sqlite_execute, locate_by_name, sort, slice, argon2, argon2_verify, connection_name_lookup
    - set_thread_mode (an argument of 0 will disable threading for all builtins in the current verb, 1 will re-enable, and no arguments will print the current mode)
    - `thread_pool()` (database control over the the thread pools)

- FileIO improvements:
    - Faster reading
    - Open as many files as you want, configurable with FILE_IO_MAX_FILES or $server_options.file_io_max_files
    - `file_handles()` (returns a list of open files)
    - `file_grep()` (search for a string in a file (kind of FUP in FIO, don't tell))
    - `file_count_lines()` (counts the number of lines in a file)

- Profiling and debugging:
    - `finished_tasks()` (returns a list of the last X tasks to finish executing, including their total execution time) [see options.h below]
    - Set a maximum lag threshold (can be overridden with $server_options.task_lag_threshold) that, when exceeded, will make a note in the server log and call #0:handle_lagging_task with arguments: {callers, execution time}
    - Include a map of defined variables for stack frames when being passed to `handle_uncaught_error`, `handle_task_timeout`, and `handle_lagging_task` [see options.h below]
    - Optionally capture defined variables for running tasks by providing a true argument to `queued_tasks()` or a third true argument to `task_stack()`.

- Telnet:
    - Capture IAC commands and pass them to listener:do_out_of_band_command() for the database to handle.

- Stunt Improvements
    - Primitive types:
        - Support calling verbs on an object prototype ($obj_proto). Counterintuitively, this will only work for types of OBJ that are invalid. This can come in useful for un-logged-in connections (i.e. creating a set of convenient utilities for dealing with negative connections in-MOO).
    - Maps:
        - `maphaskey()` (check if a key exists in a map. Looks nicer than `!(x in mapkeys(map))` and is faster when not dealing with hundreds of keys)

- Options.h configuration:
    - LOG_CODE_CHANGES (causes .program and set_verb_code to add a line to the server log indicating the object, verb, and programmer)
    - OWNERSHIP_QUOTA (disable the server's builtin quota management)
    - USE_ANCESTOR_CACHE (enable a cache of an object's ancestors to speed up property lookups)
    - UNSAFE_FIO (skip character by character line verification, trading off potential safety for speed)
    - LOG_EVALS (add an entry to the server log any time eval is called)
    - ONLY_32_BITS (switch from 64-bit integers back to 32-bit)
    - MAX_LINE_BYTES (unceremoniously close connections that send lines exceeding this value to prevent memory allocation panics)
    - DEFAULT_LAG_THRESHOLD (the number of seconds allowed before a task is considered laggy and triggers #0:handle_lagging_task)
    - SAVE_FINISHED_TASKS (enable the finished_tasks function and define how many tasks get saved by default) [default can be overridden with $server_options.finished_tasks_limit]
    - THREAD_ARGON2 (enable threading of Argon2 functions)
    - TOTAL_BACKGROUND_THREADS (number of threads created at runtime)
    - DEFAULT_THREAD_MODE (default mode of threaded functions)
    - SAFE_RECYCLE (change ownership of everything an object owns before recycling it)
    - NO_NAME_LOOKUP (disable automatic DNS name resolution on new connections. Can be overridden with $server_options.no_name_lookup)
    - PCRE_PATTERN_CACHE_SIZE (specifies how many PCRE patterns are cached)
    - INCLUDE_RT_VARS (Include runtime environment variables in the stack argument for `handle_uncaught_error`, `handle_task_timeout`, and `handle_lagging_task`)

- Additional builtins:
    - frandom (random floats)
    - distance (calculate the distance between an arbitrary number of points)
    - relative_heading (a relative bearing between two coordinate sets)
    - memory_usage (total memory used, resident set size, shared pages, text, data + stack)
    - ftime (precise time, including an argument for monotonic timing)
    - locate_by_name (quickly locate objects by their .name property)
    - usage (returns {load averages}, user time, system time, page reclaims, page faults, block input ops, block output ops, voluntary context switches, involuntary context switches, signals received)
    - explode (serverified version of the LambdaCore verb on $string_utils)
    - slice (serverified version of the LambdaCore verb on $list_utils)
    - occupants (return a list of objects of parent parent, optionally with a player flag check)
    - spellcheck (uses Aspell to check spelling)
    - locations (recursive location function)
    - clear_ancestor_cache (clears the ancestor cache manually)
    - chr (return extended ASCII characters; characters that can corrupt your database are considered invalid)
    - reseed_random (reseed the random number generator)
    - yin (yield if needed. Replicates :suspend_if_needed and ticks_left() checks)
    - sort (a significantly faster replacement for the :sort verb. Also allows for natural sort order and reverse sorting)
    - recreate (fill holes created by recycle() by recreating valid objects with those object numbers)
    - recycled_objects (return a list of all objects destroyed by calling recycle())
    - next_recycled_object (return the next object available for recreation)
    - reverse (reverse lists)
    - all_members (return the indices of all instances of a type in a list)
    - curl (return webpage as string)
    - owned_objects (returns all valid objects owned by an object)
    - connection_name_lookup (perform a DNS name lookup)
    - connection_info (show detailed information about a particular connection)
    - parse_ansi (parses color tags into their ANSI equivalents)
    - remove_ansi (strips ANSI tags from strings)

- Miscellaneous changes:
    - .last_move (a map of an object's last location and the time() it moved)
    - Sub-second fork and suspend
    - Call 'do_blank_command' on listening objects when a blank command is issued
    - Allow `"string" in "some other string"` as a shortcut for index()
    - Allow exec to set environment variables with a new argument
    - Change the server log message when calling switch_player()
    - Deprecation of `tonum()` in favor of `toint()`
    - Move #0.dump_interval to $server_options.dump_interval
    - New argument to `notify()` to suppress the newline
    - Support object lists in `isa()` as well as an optional third argument to return the matching parent rather than simply true or false
    - New argument to `move()` to effectively `listinsert()` the object into the destination's .contents
    - New argument to `is_member()` for controlling case sensitivity of equality comparisons. No third argument or a true value results in standard functionality; a false value as the third argument results in case not mattering at all
    - Update `random()` to accept a second optional argument for setting the maximum value returned. Including the second argument will treat the first argument as the minimum.
    - SIGUSR1 will close and reopen the logfile, allowing it to be rotated without restarting the server.
    - '-m' command line option to clear all last_move properties in your database (and not set them again for the lifetime of the process).
    - Build system is now CMake
    - Boolean (BOOL) type
    - Allow handling of SIGUSR signals in the database with `#0:handle_signal()`

## Build Instructions
### **Debian/Ubuntu**
```bash
apt install build-essential bison gperf cmake libsqlite3-dev libaspell-dev libpcre3-dev nettle-dev g++ libcurl4-openssl-dev libargon2-dev libssl-dev libexpat1-dev
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make -j2
```

### **REL/CentOS**
```bash
yum group install -y "Development Tools"
yum install -y sqlite-devel pcre-devel aspell-devel nettle-devel gperf centos-release-scl expat-devel
yum install -y devtoolset-7
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make -j2
```

### **Gentoo**
```bash
emerge dev-db/sqlite app-text/aspell app-crypt/argon2 dev-libs/expat cmake 
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make -j2
```

### **FreeBSD**
```bash
pkg install bison gperf gcc cmake sqlite3 aspell pcre nettle
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make -j2
```

### **macOS**
Installing dependencies requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Follow the instructions in the notes section below to compile and install Argon2. **NOTE**: In the last step, the install prefix should be changed to `/usr/local`

```bash
brew install pcre aspell nettle cmake
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make -j2
```

## **Notes**
### Argon2
Many distributions do not include [Libargon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) which is required for Argon2id password hashing. As such, it has been included as a Git submodule in this repository. To build it yourself, follow these steps:

1. Inside of the ToastStunt repository, checkout all available submodules: `git submodule update --init`
2. `cd src/dependencies/phc-winner-argon2`
3. Build the library: `make`
4. Install it on your system: `make install PREFIX=/usr`

**NOTE**: macOS users should instead use `make install PREFIX=/usr/local` in step 4.

**NOTE**: FreeBSD users should use `gmake`.

### CMake Build Options
There are a few build options available to developers:

| Build Option | Effect                                                                       |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Release      | Optimizations enabled, warnings disabled.                                    |
| Debug        | Optimizations disabled, debug enabled.                                       |
| Warn         | Optimizations enabled, warnings enabled. (Previous default behavior)         |
| LeakCheck    | Minimal optimizations enabled, debug enabled, and address sanitizer enabled. |

To change the build, use: `cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=BuildNameHere ../`

### Login screen not showing
Due to the way proxy detection works, if you're connecting to your MOO from localhost, you won't see the login screen. This is a minor inconvenience and shouldn't affect your ability to actually use your MOO. However, if it bothers you, you can disable HAProxy rewriting:

1. `@prop $server_options.proxy_rewrite 0`
2. `;load_server_options()`
